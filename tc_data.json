The process is so agonising that they consent to a demonic pact to bring end to their pain. Thus a new Goetic Warlock is born, ready to hunt the living they once swore to protect.<br/> The mere gaze of the warlock causes necrosis and in close quarters they embrace unsuspecting enemies with their iron claws, using their goetic magic to gate themselves to a secluded location where they can finish their victim by slowly shredding them apart.<br/>Due to the rarity of victims required to create Goetic Warlocks, they are only assigned to the Heretic commanders with the greatest renown, need and the required connections in the twisted web of Heretic politics."

Millions perished on the road and at sea, for the Heretics and their Shaytan lords swarmed them as locusts swarm fields of ripe sesame, devouring them and building vile monuments from their limbs and heads, so they could not be buried as is decreed in the Holy texts. But once all those who survived the journey had come, the mighty Gates of al-Qarnayn were closed and the Great Sultanate of the Invincible Iron Wall of the Two Horns That Pierce the Sky was formed"

When they reach the ranks of the faithful, the Janissaries, Sultan’s elite household troops, close in and finish the enemy with their devastating counter-charge led by their iron- willed officers. Dreaded Assassins from Alamut prowl in the winds of time, striking the enemy elites and leaders, while the Alchemists of the House of Wisdom unleash devastating weapons made deadly by their elemental mastery, capable of overcoming the defences of virtually any foe."

Though an understanding between the Church and the Sultanate on being co- belligerents against Jahannam exists, the commanders of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and do not hesitate to crush those who would hinder their mission. Resentment against the infidels who unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate, and matters of honour are swiftly resolved with duels to the death. Woe to those who dare to hinder the mission of Those Who Believe."

To this day New Antioch has withstood eight great sieges and its famed walls, with their seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been breached.

These warbands are simply given commission by the Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster their own forces. However, holy relics, great wealth and fame across all the Christendom ensures that there is a steady supply of ambitious leaders who are willing to risk all in the crucible of war. Competition for loot, supplies, artefacts and information is fierce, and these warbands often come to blows, not just with Heretical forces, but with competing rivals and crazed Trench Pilgrims."
