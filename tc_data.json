The process is so agonising that they consent to a demonic pact to bring end to their pain. Thus a new Goetic Warlock is born, ready to hunt the living they once swore to protect.<br/> The mere gaze of the warlock causes necrosis and in close quarters they embrace unsuspecting enemies with their iron claws, using their goetic magic to gate themselves to a secluded location where they can finish their victim by slowly shredding them apart.<br/>Due to the rarity of victims required to create Goetic Warlocks, they are only assigned to the Heretic commanders with the greatest renown, need and the required connections in the twisted web of Heretic politics."

Within its spiked, blood-stained interior, the pilot- monk endures a terrible form of penance, his anguished prayers and chants echoing across the battlefield. This grotesque amalgamation of suffering and devotion instils fear in the heart of the heretic, as the anchorite, a malevolent weapon draped in holy iconography and weeping gore, emerges to unleash a symphony of slaughter, where the wretched union of man and machine heralds the demise of all who oppose the Almighty."

Millions perished on the road and at sea, for the Heretics and their Shaytan lords swarmed them as locusts swarm fields of ripe sesame, devouring them and building vile monuments from their limbs and heads, so they could not be buried as is decreed in the Holy texts.

Though an understanding between the Church and the Sultanate on being co- belligerents against Jahannam exists, the commanders of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and do not hesitate to crush those who would hinder their mission. Resentment against the infidels who unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate, and matters of honour are swiftly resolved with duels to the death. Woe to those who dare to hinder the mission of Those Who Believe."

To this day New Antioch has withstood eight great sieges and its famed walls, with their seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been breached. This is partly due to hundreds of anchorites, metallic battle shrines with devotees entombed within them, that are embedded into the walls, keeping a vigilant watch over the walls day and night."

These warbands are simply given commission by the Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster their own forces. However, holy relics, great wealth and fame across all the Christendom ensures that there is a steady supply of ambitious leaders who are willing to risk all in the crucible of war. Competition for loot, supplies, artefacts and information is fierce, and these warbands often come to blows, not just with Heretical forces, but with competing rivals and crazed Trench Pilgrims."

Each one of those who have fallen have been found to be a Heretic infiltrator, and their broken and rotting bodies are left unburied as a warning to those traitors who would defile the sanctity of the shrine."
